This repository contains different Data Science projects. Each folder has its own README file with more details.

#### Summary of projects:

**01 - Weather Forecast using OpenWeatherMap API**
A Python 3 application that fetches real‑time weather data from OpenWeatherMap—using city/state or ZIP code lookups—and presents a concise, customizable summary (temperature, feels‑like, highs/lows, pressure, humidity, and description) while emphasizing robust input validation, error handling, and clean, well‑commented code.

**02 - Analysis of Job Postings and H-1B Visas approvals in United States**
An R project that predicts the probability a job posting includes H‑1B sponsorship by modeling features such as description, salary, employer, and state, while also revealing salary trends across regions and industries to guide job‑seekers' decisions.

**03 - Introduction to Machine Learning**
An R notebook that walk through beginner‑level machine‑learning exercises—implementing and evaluating k‑NN classifiers, comparing them to linear models, and applying k‑means clustering with elbow‑method analysis—to give hands‑on practice with core supervised and unsupervised techniques.

**04 - Thoracic Surgery Binary Dataset**
A R project that builds and evaluates logistic‑regression models on two binary‑outcome datasets—the UCI thoracic surgery set (predicting 1‑year survival after lung cancer surgery) and a simple synthetic dataset—using glm(), summarizing influential predictors, and measuring predictive accuracy.

**05 - Housing Data Analysis**
A R‑based housing‑price analysis that cleans a 1964‑2016 real‑estate dataset, builds single‑ and multiple‑variable linear regression models to predict sale price, and evaluates performance through residual diagnostics, RMSE, and ANOVA comparisons.

**06 - Individual age of death and related factors**
A Python (or Jupyter) workflow that loads a 10 K‑record JSON dataset of lifestyle habits and age at death, then performs exploratory data analysis—including descriptive stats, histogram visualizations, random sampling, covariance, Pearson and Spearman correlations, and various data splits—to uncover relationships between behaviors and longevity.

**07 - Unlocking Cognitive Health Insights**
A data‑science project that predicts cognitive‑health scores from personal and lifestyle variables (age, sleep, stress, diet, exercise, etc.) using Linear Regression and Random Forest models—finding Linear Regression to be the most accurate—and delivers actionable insights for personalized health, workplace wellness, and research while emphasizing privacy, validation, and bias mitigation.

**08 - Data Preparation – Bringing data from three different sources together**
A data‑science pipeline that loads three cleaned tables into SQLite, merges them via SQL joins, and then visualizes cross‑dataset insights with Matplotlib/Seaborn—accompanied by thorough documentation and a discussion of ethical and legal considerations surrounding data integration.

**09 - Predicting Social Media Engagement Rate**
A machine‑learning project that predicts social‑media engagement rates (likes + shares + comments ÷ impressions) for 12 K posts across YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram using feature‑rich data (platform, timing, language, sentiment, toxicity, etc.) and comparing Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost—finding XGBoost to deliver the most accurate and generalizable forecasts while highlighting key drivers for content strategy.

**10 - Creation and Edition of images using Generative AI APIs (Stable Diffusion)**
A Jupyter‑Notebook workflow that uses the Stable Diffusion API to generate photorealistic images from text prompts and then programmatically edit them via masked prompts, showcasing Python‑driven API integration, image decoding, and reproducible code for exploring generative‑AI creation and manipulation.

**11 - Fine-Tune LLM**
A data-science project that fine-tunes a large language model on a curated set of Chuck Norris' jokes so the model can answer factual queries while automatically appending a concise, over-the-top Chuck Norris' punchline tailored to the topic, demonstrating that LLMs can learn and reliably generate a specific humor style.

**12 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System System**
A Python RAG pipeline that ingests the “Day of the Dead” Wikipedia page, creates chunk embeddings stored in a Chroma vector store, and uses OpenAI models with custom prompts to retrieve relevant passages and generate concise, context‑bound answers—demonstrating a trustworthy, domain‑specific chatbot architecture.
