# Analysis of Job Postings and H-1B Visa Approvals in the United States

This R-based project analyzes job postings and H-1B visa approval data to predict the likelihood that a job posting offers H-1B sponsorship. The model uses features such as job description, salary, employer name, and state to estimate sponsorship probability.

The analysis supports job seekers in identifying employers and locations more likely to offer H-1B sponsorship, helping them make data-driven career decisions. It also examines salary trends across states and industries, highlighting variations in compensation and labor market conditions.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation steps implemented in R. It was completed prior to recent updates to the H-1B sponsorship program, so results reflect conditions before those changes.

### Skills

 - Data Acquisition and Integration
 - Importing, merging, and managing large datasets from multiple sources.
 - Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and standardizing text (job titles, employer names, locations).
 - Data Exploration and Analysis
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for pattern discovery and hypothesis formation.
 - Descriptive statistics, demographic analysis, and time series analysis.
 - Segmenting and grouping data by job, employer, region, and demographic attributes.
 - Statistical Modeling and Predictive Analytics
 - Applying statistical tests to compare groups and trends.
 - Building and interpreting predictive models (e.g., linear regression) for visa approval likelihood.
 - Data Visualization and Reporting
 - Designing and creating visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, box plots) using tools like ggplot2.
 - Summarizing results in tables and clear markdown documentation.
 - Programming and Tool Proficiency
 - Proficiency in R and relevant packages: dplyr, ggplot2, scales, lubridate.
 - Version control and collaborative workflow using Git and GitHub.
 - Markdown for documentation.
 - Critical Thinking and Domain Knowledge
 - Understanding of H-1B visa processes, U.S. labor market, and relevant policy implications.
 - Ability to interpret data limitations, biases, and the impact of changing regulations.
 
 These skills collectively enable comprehensive end-to-end analysis, from data ingestion and cleaning to advanced analytics, visualization, and actionable insight generation.
