## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Python and OpenAI models. The objective is to build a chatbot capable of answering questions about a specific topic—in this case, the "Day of the Dead" Wikipedia article—by retrieving relevant information from a vector database and generating concise answers.

The workflow includes loading content from Wikipedia, splitting the text into manageable chunks, storing the data as embeddings in a Chroma vector database, and querying the database using OpenAI's language models with custom prompts.

The project showcases how to constrain the chatbot to answer strictly based on the provided context and to admit when it does not know the answer. This approach is valuable for creating trustworthy, context-aware AI assistants that can be easily adapted to other knowledge domains.
