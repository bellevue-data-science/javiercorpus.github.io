## Unlocking Cognitive Health Insights

Unlocking Cognitive Health Insights is a data science project focused on developing predictive models for assessing cognitive health using a variety of personal, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. This project aims to leverage data-driven approaches to better understand and anticipate cognitive strengths and challenges, ultimately enabling more proactive interventions in settings such as healthcare, corporate wellness, and education.

The project utilizes a dataset containing features like age, gender, sleep duration, stress level, diet type, screen time, exercise frequency, caffeine intake, and results from cognitive and memory tests. Through rigorous data preparation and analysis, two primary machine learning models—Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor—were built and evaluated to predict cognitive scores. The Linear Regression model outperformed Random Forest, demonstrating strong predictive accuracy when supported by comprehensive data preprocessing.

The insights derived from this project can be used to personalize cognitive development plans, inform organizational decision-making, and support ongoing research in cognitive health. The entire modeling process adheres to data privacy standards and emphasizes model validation and bias mitigation to ensure robust and ethical outcomes.
