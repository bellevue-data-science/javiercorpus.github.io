## Fit a Logistic Regression Model to Thoracic Surgery Binary Dataset

This project involves applying logistic regression techniques to two datasets to predict binary outcomes. The primary focus is on the thoracic surgery dataset from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository, which contains information on life expectancy in lung cancer patients after surgery. The goal is to build a logistic regression model using R that predicts whether a patient survives for one year post-surgery (captured by the Risk1Y variable). The project also includes fitting a logistic regression model to the binary-classifier-data.csv dataset, which comprises two predictor variables (x and y) and a binary label.

For both tasks, the model fitting is performed using R's glm() function for logistic regression. The project includes generating a model summary with summary() to identify the most influential variables on survival rates, and calculating predictive accuracy by comparing model predictions to actual outcomes.

This repository contains all code, data preparation steps, and results necessary for understanding, reproducing, and evaluating the logistic regression models, as required by the assignment instructions.
