## Introduction to Machine Learning

This repository contains solutions to introductory machine learning exercises focusing on classification and clustering using R. The assignments are designed to help users gain hands-on experience with core data science tools and concepts, including supervised and unsupervised learning. Specifically, the project includes:

 - Implementing and evaluating the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm on binary and trinary classification datasets, with accuracy analysis across different values of k.
 - Visualizing classification results and discussing the effectiveness of linear classifiers versus k-NN, with a comparison to logistic regression approaches.
 - Applying k-means clustering to an unlabeled dataset to discover inherent data structure, visualizing cluster assignments for multiple values of k, and identifying the optimal number of clusters using the “elbow method.”
 - Utilizing metrics such as model accuracy for supervised learning and average distance to cluster centers for unsupervised learning.

The goal of this project is to provide a practical introduction to data science concepts, supporting learners in assessing their familiarity with machine learning workflows and model evaluation in R.
