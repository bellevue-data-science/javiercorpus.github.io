## Predicting Social Media Engagement Rate

This project focuses on predicting social media engagement rates using advanced machine learning techniques. Social media engagement rate, defined as the ratio of likes, shares, and comments to impressions, is a vital metric for measuring marketing effectiveness and optimizing brand visibility online. By analyzing a robust dataset containing 12,000 posts across five major platforms (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram), this project aims to answer key questions about which features most strongly influence engagement and whether these relationships vary by platform.

The core objective is to build predictive models that estimate engagement rates based on features such as platform, posting day, location, language, emotion type, toxicity score, interactions (likes, shares, comments), impressions, and sentiment. Methods include exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of three machine learning models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Model performance is evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

The findings show that while simple linear models are insufficient, advanced models like Random Forest and XGBoost provide strong predictive power, with XGBoost offering a more reliable balance between accuracy and generalizability. Insights from feature importance analysis help inform content and platform strategies for social media managers. The project also discusses limitations (e.g., lack of video-specific metrics, evolving platform algorithms) and suggests directions for future work, such as expanding the dataset and incorporating temporal trends.
