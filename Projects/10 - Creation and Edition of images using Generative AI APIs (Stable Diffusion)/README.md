## Creation and Edition of images using Generative AI APIs

#### Stable Diffusion API Image Creation and Editing Project

This project demonstrates how to use the Stable Diffusion API to generate and edit images programmatically within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The workflow includes creating a photorealistic image from a text prompt and then editing that image by applying a mask and sending instructions to the API for further transformation. The process leverages Python libraries to handle API requests, image decoding, and file management.

The primary goal is to explore the capabilities and limitations of generative AI (GAI) models for automated image creation and editing, emphasizing hands-on experience with API integration and image manipulation via code. The project also includes commentary on ease of use and practical challenges, such as mask creation and the inherent non-determinism of AI-generated images.

Key Features:
 - Generate high-quality images from detailed text prompts using Stable Diffusion API
 - Edit existing images by applying custom masks and new prompts
 - Handle image data transfer, decoding, and file saving
 - Document the process and results for reproducibility and evaluation

This repository provides all code samples, explanations, and narrative from the project, enabling other users to reproduce the workflow or adapt it for their own data science or machine learning experiments.
