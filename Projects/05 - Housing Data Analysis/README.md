## Housing Data Analysis

This repository contains code and documentation for a housing data analysis project focused on real estate transactions from 1964 to 2016. The goal of the project is to explore the relationship between property features and sale price using statistical methods and R programming. Key objectives include cleaning and transforming the dataset, building linear regression models to predict sale price based on one or multiple predictors, and evaluating model performance using residual analysis, normality checks, and accuracy metrics such as RMSE. The project also involves comparing model results to assess improvement and significance using ANOVA. All code and outputs are included for reproducibility.
