## Data Preparation – Bringing data from three different sources together

This project demonstrates the process of merging, cleansing, and visualizing data from multiple sources using modern data science tools and best practices. The primary objective is to transform three cleaned and structured datasets into a single, comprehensive dataset by loading each as a table in a relational database (SQLite in this case) and performing SQL joins. After merging the data, the project showcases analytical insights through visualizations, which integrate information from more than one dataset. The visualizations are created using popular tools such as Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

This workflow emphasizes not only technical skills but also critical thinking about the ethical and legal implications of data transformation and analysis. The deliverables include fully documented code, human-readable final datasets, and a summary addressing the methods and ethical considerations involved in the project.
